- **Branding**: Consistent with application theme

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Brevo email service not configured"**
   - Check that `BREVO_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
   - Verify the API key is correct and active

2. **"Failed to send email"**
   - Check your sender email is verified in Brevo
   - Ensure your domain DNS is properly configured
   - Check Brevo dashboard for any account issues

3. **"Invalid API key"**
   - Regenerate your API key in Brevo dashboard
   - Ensure you have the correct permissions

4. **"Sender not verified"**
   - Complete domain verification in Brevo
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)

### Testing Steps

1. **Configuration Test**
   ```bash
   npm run test:brevo
   ```

2. **Connection Test**
   - Check Brevo dashboard for API usage
   - Verify sender email status

3. **Email Delivery Test**
   ```bash
   npm run test:brevo your@email.com
   ```

4. **Production Test**
   - Register a new user account
   - Check email delivery and confirmation flow

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Email tokens have expiration times (24h for confirmation, 1h for reset)
- All emails include security disclaimers
- Password reset tokens are single-use
- Email addresses are validated before sending

## Monitoring

Monitor your email service through:
- Brevo dashboard analytics
- Application logs
- Email delivery reports
- User feedback

## Cost Considerations

Brevo offers:
- **Free Tier**: 300 emails/day
- **Paid Plans**: Starting at $25/month for 20,000 emails
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for high volume

For most applications, the free tier is sufficient for development and small-scale production use.

If you're migrating from the previous nodemailer setup:

1. The new Brevo service maintains the same API interface
2. No changes needed to existing code
3. Better deliverability and analytics
4. More reliable email delivery
5. Professional email templates
