### Backend Testing

1. **Test API endpoints directly:**
   ```bash
   # Test crypto payment endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/subscribe/crypto \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"planId": "pro"}'

   # Test crypto subscription endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/subscribe/crypto-subscription \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"planId": "pro"}'
   ```

2. **Check server logs:**

### 2. Test Webhook Delivery

```bash
# Use ngrok for local testing
ngrok http 3001

# Update webhook URL in NOWPayments dashboard to:
# https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/nowpayments
```

### 3. Monitor Webhook Calls

Check your server logs for webhook events:
```bash
# In your server console, you should see:
# NOWPayments webhook received: { payment_id: '...', status: 'finished' }
```
