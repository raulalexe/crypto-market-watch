await releaseScheduleService.initializeCalendar();
releaseScheduleService.startNotificationChecker();
```

```bash
node test-release-schedule.js
```

### Accessing the Dashboard
Navigate to `/app/releases` in the web application to access the release schedule dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Calendar not loading**

   - Check server logs for initialization errors

2. **Notifications not sending**
   - Verify Telegram bot configuration
   - Check email service settings
   - Ensure notification intervals are properly set

3. **Strategy recommendations not updating**
   - Check system time synchronization
   - Verify release schedule data
   - Monitor API endpoint responses
